# Pizza Task

### How to Run

Hi Suz!! in your terminal run the following command:

```bash
node index input/example.in
```

The last command-line parameter is the file name to process.
you can use example 1 or example 2 just to test it, you can also try writing and using a larger data source

The output will go to the `output` directory.
You will also get an html file that will visualize the result
